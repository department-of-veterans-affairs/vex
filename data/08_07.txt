F/U chronic problems.

Subjective

Hypertension
Pt reports mild light-headedness; he doesnt think it is any worse with standing and thinks he might just be a little dehydrated because he hasnt had much to drink or eat today.


Parkinson disease
Tremor and bradykinesia are adequately controlled per pts perspective.

Osteoarthritis
The patient reports gradually worsening knee pain over the last few months.  Acetaminophen is no longer sufficient to control the pain.  Knee pain is 6/10 today.  He denies falls and recent trauma.  He is still able to get around fine without an assistive device, but it hurts a lot on a daily basis.  He is interested in trying a stronger pain medication for this.  He does not use NSAIDs because when he takes that kind of medication he gets severe abd pain.  Of note, the pt is not interested in knee surgery/replacement at this time.
