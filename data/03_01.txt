CC
New patient here to establish care.

Subjective
The patient indicates she recently moved to this state about 6 months ago.  She moved here to be closer to her children.



Hypertension
The patient was diagnosed with HTN when she was about 55 years old.  For the past 2 years her BP has been well controlled using HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, Lisinopril 20 mg daily and Metoprolol 25 mg BID.  She confirms that she is compliant with use of all of these medications and denies significant side effects from their use (i.e. no light-headedness and no kidney disease or electrolyte abnormality that she knows of).

Osteoarthritis
The patient has moderate osteoarthritis in her right hip and both of her knees.  Her pain is adequately controlled (4/10) with use of Lortab 5 mg BID PRN and Acetaminophen  500 mg q 6 hours PRN.  She uses Tylenol on a daily basis but uses Lortab only a few times a week.

Coronary Artery Disease
In 2005 the patient underwent workup for chest pain that revealed significant CAD.  She subsequently underwent CABG (3V).  Since that time she has not had any significant chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient does use a daily, low dose Aspirin.

Hyperlipidemia
The patient indicates her cholesterol was high at her last clinic visit with her previous primary care provider about 6 months ago.  Simvastatin was increased from 40 mg to 80 mg daily at that time.

Osteoporosis
The patient was diagnosed with Osteoporosis after breaking her left hip in 2006.  The L hip fracture occurred after she fell from a short step stool.  This was a mechanical fall resulting from a simple miss-step as opposed to a medical condition.  The patient subsequently underwent L total hip arthroplasty and has faithfully been taking Alendronate 70 mg weekly since then.  She gets about 5 servings of dairy products per day in her diet.  She takes ergocalciferol 800 IU daily.
