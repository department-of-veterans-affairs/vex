CC
New patient here to establish care.

Subjective
The patient was recently divorced and has just moved to town.  She has 2 children who live with her.  She has several chronic problems as noted below.  All are well controlled currently.

Diabetes mellitus type 2
The patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 about 3 years ago.  She has been overweight all her life she says and she thinks that is the cause of her diabetes.  However, she has had little success with dieting.  She finds exercising to be quite difficult given her size.  The patient took Metformin for a few days when she was first diagnosed but did not tolerate it.  She is currently well controlled on Glyburide.  She says her last HbA1c was about 7.3, which is about where it has been for the last 1-2 years.  The pt report that she has had no foot, eye or kidney problems and has no known cardiovascular disease.  She last saw her ophthalmologist about 1 month ago and her eyes were fine; she was told she was not due for another eye exam until October 2010.  The patient denies ever having any symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes.


Hypertension
3 years ago the patient started taking Lisinopril and Chlorthalidone for hypertension.  Her BP has been good recently (about 120s/70s).  She denies light-headedness.


History of malignant neoplasm of thyroid
In 2002 the patient was diagnosed with thyroid cancer (she doesnt remember what type); there was no evidence of metastasis at the time she was diagnosed.  Her thyroid was completely removed.  She has had no recurrence.


Osteopenia
The patient had a DXA scan about 3 months ago because her doctor thought she should given her FH of osteoporosis.  Her DXA scan was only slightly abnormal (osteopenia) so she was told to take calcium and vitamin D, which she has been doing.


Postoperative hypothyroidism
The patient has been using levothyroxine 125 mcg daily for postoperative hypothyroidism.  Her TSH was last checked about 1 year ago and was normal.  She currently has no constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, insomnia or palpitations.


Depression
About 3 months ago the patient started Fluoxetine for depression.  It caused severe anxiety so she was tried on Citalopram, which also caused severe anxiety.  She is now taking Venlafaxine 75 mg BID and her depression symptoms are very well controlled.  Since her divorce has been made final, she feels less stress over that issue as well.  She currently denies SI and HI and states she rarely feels depressed now.


Hyperlipidemia
The patient currently uses Simvastatin 80 mg daily for her hyperlipidemia.  Her LDL has been well controlled for about 1 year on this dose; she is due for cholesterol check today.  She is fasting (she has not taken her Glyburide yet).
