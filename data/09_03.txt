Knee Pain

Subjective
The patient complains of knee pain X about 6 months.  Onset has been gradual.  Pain has been especially bad over the last 3 weeks during which time she has been more active than usual (she has been doing odd jobs around her community).  She does experience morning stiffness, but it resolves within about 5 minutes after getting out of bed.  Her pain is constant, but is much worse in the evenings after she has been working throughout the day.  She has used acetaminophen, which adequately controls the pain when she uses it.  She did not take acetaminophen today.  She denies h/o knee trauma.  Her current knee pain is about 7/10, which is as bad as it ever gets. She denies knee popping, locking, redness, swelling and excessive warmth.

Patient went to the lab this morning for repeat chem14 to follow up elevated LFTs.

The patient indicates her BP has been good (less than 130/80) each time she has checked it on her own.
