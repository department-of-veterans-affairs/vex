CC
The patient wants a screening cardiac exercise stress test.

Subjective
The patient is a new patient that has been living in another state until recently.  He has several medical problems, but they are all currently well controlled on his current medication regimen.  The patient confirms being compliant with use of his medications and requests all meds be filled today.

The patient also requests I order a cardiac exercise stress test.  His father died of an MI at the age of 53.  The patient denies angina and dyspnea.  He does not exercise much because his knee hurts when he walks.  He doesnt follow any special diet.

Hypertension
The patient only uses Hydrochlorothiazide for his HTN.  His BP has been well controlled.  He doesnt like to get his SBP below 130 because it makes him dizzy.  He denies light-headedness today.

Parkinson disease
The patient was diagnosed with Parkinson disease at the age of 69.  His disease has recently been well controlled on Carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg TID.  He has a tremor that is well tolerated. 

Osteoarthritis
The patient experiences mild knee pain from osteoarthritis on a daily basis, but is able to control this pain adequately with use of Acetaminophen.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia
The patient has significant BPH symptoms including urinary hesitancy, weak stream and nocturia (about 2 times per night).  However, he indicates this is pretty good for him and he does not want to increase, change or add medication for BPH at this time.

Depression
The patient indicates that he has been taking Citalopram for depression for as long as he can remember.  He had severe depression before starting Citalopram and is happy to continue that medication.  He denies SI and HI today.

Hyperlipidemia
The patient was recently told he had high cholesterol and should increase his simvastatin.  He didnt increase simvastatin because he wanted to try working on his diet first.  However, he hasnt changed his diet and is now willing to increase his dose of simvastatin if needed.  He is not fasting today but is willing to return for labs sometime in the next month.  Of note, the pt indicates he does not want to quit smoking right now but may be willing to discuss this in the future.
