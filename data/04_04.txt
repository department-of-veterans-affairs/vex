Assessment and Plan

Chronic diastolic heart failure
Assessment
New diagnosis of Chronic diastolic heart failure.
I spoke with cardiology attending that was able to give me a preliminary reading of the echocardiogram done today; it reveals normal LVEF(60%) and significant LVH (consistent with diastolic heart failure).  EKG c/w LVH.  Pulmonary edema noted on CXR explains her shortness of breath.  The patient has been in the ER for about 6 hours now; she has urinarted about 2 liters of fluid since receiving a 40 mg IV dose of Furosemide; her oxygen saturation is now 94% on RA (89% on RA on presentation).  The patient is appropriate for discharge from the ER now.
Plan
Start Furosemide 20 mg daily today to decrease SBP and Edema (peripheral)
Check CXR
Check BNP
Check ECG
Check TTE
Check Chem14
Check CBC
Follow up with PCP 2-3 days.
