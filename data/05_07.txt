Misc.
Assessment
Obesity: the patients BMI is on the lower limit of the obese category - this was communicated to the patient.  The patient seems to be motivated to lose weight.
Plan
Obesity: I informed the patient that decreasing his portion sizes to about 2000 calories per day and increasing his activity by walking about 30 minutes, 5 days per week would be a good goal for him.  I agree that setting a goal weight range of 150 to 180 pounds (BMI of about 23 to 27) would be appropriate.
RTC 6 months.
