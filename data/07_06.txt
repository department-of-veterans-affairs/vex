Depression
The patient informs me that he has been feeling quite depressed lately.  He lost his job about 3 months ago.  He has been trying to get a job, but for the last 2 months he has been struggling to even get out of bed because he feels so depressed.  He sleeps about 16 hours per day.  His appetite is decreased - he thinks he has lost about 10 pounds.  He does not enjoy any of his previous hobbies and finds it hard to concentrate on looking for work.  He feels guilty for not working harder to find a job.    He denies suicidal ideation.  He is interested in medication for his symptoms but refuses to go to counseling at this time.
