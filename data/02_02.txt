Subjective
56 y.o. male presents for follow up post ER visit about 1 week ago where he was diagnosed with mild COPD exacerbation and Acute sinusitis. 

Chronic sinusitis
The patient reports that for many years he was getting sinusitis about 5 times per year, but about 2 years ago he had sinus surgery and since then he gets acute sinusitis about once every year.  The patient was started on Amoxicillin for acute sinusitis 1 week ago and has about 3 days left of his antibiotic course.  His symptoms have greatly improved including decrease in nasal congestion, nasal drainage and sinus pressure/pain.  He denies fever, chills, nausea and chest pain now.


Allergic rhinitis
The patient reports he was prescribed medication (cetirizine and nasal mometasone for environmental allergies earlier this year but stopped using them about 2 months ago.  He now thinks he should restart these because he has started experiencing allergy symptoms on a daily basis again (i.e. itchy eyes and throat).


Hypertension
The patient indicates he is taking Lisinopril 20 mg daily and HCTZ 25 mg daily for HTN.  His BP was high in the ER last week, but he had been without his BP meds for 2 days.  He is now back on his BP meds.  He denies light-headedness.  He denies lower extremity swelling (Edema, peripheral).

Diabetes mellitus type 2
The patient was diagnosed with type II diabetes about 10 years ago.  He was started on metformin at that time, but did not tolerate the side effects (nausea) and refuses to try metformin again.  He currently has been adequately controlled on Glipizide 5mg before breakfast every day.  His last HbA1c was 6.9 per his report.  He reports no h/o foot, kidney or eye complications.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
The patient gets mildly short of breath with activity.  He is using his Fluticasone resp., Tiotropium and Albuteral inhaled as directed now.  He was without those medications for about a week before his ER visit last week.  He was diagnosed with COPD about 3 years ago.  He was a long time user of tobacco (50-pack year) but quit about 3 years ago.  For the past year he has been using 1L of continuous flow oxygen via nasal canula at night while sleeping.  He last had PFTs done about one month ago that was consistent with COPD.  He had a sleep study that ruled out sleep apnea less than a year ago.
